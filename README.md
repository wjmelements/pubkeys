# All Public Keys
This repository stores all of my public keys, so I can easily sync them across servers.
The single point of failure is Github.
I must consider decentralized alternatives.

## Usage
### Installation
```sh
git clone git@github.com:wjmelements/pubkeys.git
cd pubkeys
./install.sh
```
### Adding a new key
```sh
ln ~/.ssh
```
### Cron
Set up cron to run ./cron.sh as will.
